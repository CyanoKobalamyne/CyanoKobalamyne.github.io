<p>It’s official. I’ve done it. We’ve done it. I, with the (vast majority of) the class of 2020 have finished sophomore year and are halfway done with our studies.</p>
<p>It’s been a long time since I’ve written a post here. There are many reasons for this, the primary ones being lack of time and motivation. But now I’m sitting on a plane again, so it’s time to tell the (shortened) story of my second year at MIT.</p>
<p>Picking up where my last post left off: I spent my entire freshman summer traveling around Europe — visited the UK and my friends studying there, went to Belgium and the Netherlands with my sister, then to Ireland with my sister and our grandparents, to France with my sister and our parents (celebrating my birthday and leaving my sister there to be an au-pair for a French family for the rest of the summer), and finally to lake Balaton to see some old friends and make new ones. Then I went back to Boston the same day I first arrived at Logan airport — this time to be a mentor for International Orientation. Fast-forward a week of cleaning our house (Number Six — my fraternity, where many of my close friends and I live) and another week of rush events, and classes started again.</p>

(Sixer is the — mostly internally used — demonym for people in Number Six.)[/caption]</p>
<p>The fall was not easy for me. Balancing all my activities, mostly crew and The Tech, with my classes was rather demanding — which is the main reason I left crew at the end of the semester. I, fool, also took 6 subjects (the MIT average being somewhere between 4 and 5). And, to be fair, it was probably not worth it. I didn’t like all of them. Ironically, the ones I liked the least were the two classes in my major. The Introductory Biology class I took mostly explored topics that I already knew or that didn’t seem particularly exciting (or useful) to me. And my biochemistry class, even though I liked the material, required memorizing a lot of things — which I hate with a passion. I don’t think people should be forced to memorize anything. For God’s sake, we’re in the 21st century, where Google, Wikipedia, and all the online books in the world are just a few clicks away and contain more information that any class can teach us, or that any of our professors can possibly know.</p>
<p>At the end of last semester, I also declared Computer Science as my second major, and took two CS classes. These two things are partially connected, because I was determined to become a CS major anyway since I stepped foot on campus, but I also liked the classes themselves a lot. One of them, Computation Structures was my favorite class that semester, and easily one of the best classes I took, and even at MIT at large. It explored how computers (in particular, their processors) work, all the way from voltages and transistors to low-level programming and operating systems. I have somewhat more ambivalent feelings about my other class, because I really liked it, but I had a conflict (and a lengthy debate) with the professors about one of the assignments (in short, I managed to sleep through a morning project presentation due to sleep deprivation), which ultimately resulted in me getting a worse grade in the class than I expected.</p>

<p>I also didn’t get a very good grade in my Real Analysis class, but I didn’t feel too bad about that, because the class was hard. It was also a class that I started taking as a listener (I missed math in my life) and ended up adding as my Sophomore Exploratory subject. This option essentially means that after final grades are announced, you get to decide between keeping your grade and “converting” the class to listener, in which case your grade is essentially erased from your transcript. In the end I kept the grade because I felt that it accurately reflected my performance, and I liked the class. Here, for example, we didn’t really have to memorize anything, as we could use the textbook during exams (they were still hard, though).</p>
<p>My sixth class was Intro to Linguistics, which I wanted to take earlier but couldn’t fit in my schedule. It required a lot of writing, since it was a CI-H (Communication Intensive) subject but I learnt a lot of linguistic theory, and then had the opportunity to apply that knowledge to describe a real-world language (I chose Slovak, the native language of one of my very good friends at MIT).</p>
<p>After all this, I went home for a well-deserved break to celebrate Christmas with my family and meet up with my friends. This year I could even stay for one more week after New Year, since I didn’t have to go back for the crew team’s winter training camp.</p>

<p>I went back to MIT shortly after a record-breaking Nor’easter blizzard hit Boston, and found a very cold, very empty, and very frozen house. Nevertheless, IAP (MIT’s January term) started the next day, as MIT decided that the weather is not bad enough to have another snow day (there was one already a few days before). This January, I took a Physics and a CS class. The former was Classical Mechanics II, and I liked it, even though it could have been taught (and graded) better. However, I absolutely loved the latter. Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, or SICP, offered under the number 6.001, was the subject that taught generations of MIT Computer Scientists how programs and programming languages worked until 2007, when changes to the curriculum resulted in its elimination. However, some MIT faculty, staff, and former students of the class thought that it would be a shame if this subject was completely forgotten, so they started offering a condensed version over IAP. Over the course of four weeks, we learnt a new programming language (Scheme, a dialect of LISP), attempted to understand it, built an interpreter for it in Scheme, so that it could evaluate itself (thereby creating a “meta-circular” evaluator), and became members of the Order of the Knights of the Lambda Calculus. I also had some off-campus fun in January, as I met with two of my friends from the 2013 EU Innovation Contest (officially EUCYS) and went skiing with a couple friends from Number Six.</p>

<p>In the spring semester, learning from my mistakes, I took more than six subjects. And, as opposed to the fall, I liked all of them! Also, none of them were in my primary field of study (chemistry and biology), which says something… In the end, I took a bunch of Computer Science classes: Intro to Algorithms, Fundamentals of Programming, Software Construction, and Intro to Machine Learning (6.006, 6.009, 6.031, and 6.036 in MIT-speak) — most of these speak for themselves. These subjects made me realize that I like most aspects of modern Computer Science — I like building good software, I love thinking algorithmically, I enjoy coding (oh yes, I do!), and I find the applications of machine learning fascinating, even though I don’t find the mathematical theory behind it very exciting. However, I found the mathematical theory of probability rather exciting (which I studied in 18.600, the more proof-based version of probability for math majors). In addition, I enrolled in Intro to Women’s and Gender Studies, which is easily the class at MIT where I learnt the most about the world around us. It was rather challenging — we had to write a lot of essays, which I’m not particularly good at — but very rewarding.</p>
<p>I also had considerably more fun this spring than last year. I became much closer to my friends at The Tech — not that I wasn’t spending half my life there already. During Spring Break, I visited Cuba with some of my friends to show them my father’s homeland — and to finally see the part of my family which ended up being closer to me after I moved to the United States. Shortly after the break, I voted, for the first time in my life, at the Hungarian parliamentary elections — for which I had to go to New York. The results were not exactly what I would have liked, but, oh well, we are a democracy; both sides have another four years to show why they were or why they should have been elected to lead or lovely country, and do something for its citizens. Together with the Class of 2020, we also received our Brass Rats — MIT’s class rings, which a great majority of the students proudly wear after surviving half of their undergraduate lives at this fine institution. This made me feel rather old, and somehow responsible for the future generations of MIT students.</p>

Instead, I chose to include a picture with the three people with whom I spent the most time during my time at MIT. Jakub, to the left, is my closest friend, geographically speaking, as he hails from Slovakia, which shares a border with Hungary. He is mentioned several times in this post, and ended up joining Number Six this year, so we see each other even more. Siranush, to my left, is my “oldest” friend at MIT, as we met in 2015 in Armenia, her homeland. We spent most of our time together freshman year, as we were taking almost all of our classes together. Michał, to the right, was my roommate freshman year. We also know each other from before MIT, as we went to two International Chemistry Olympiads together; he, as a member of the Polish team, I, as a member of the Hungarian team. I would also have included a photo of our class year in Number Six but, on each picture, either not everyone is there or something else is wrong.

<p>Towards the end of the semester, I became rather desperate in my job search. I was overwhelmed with work and started applying for summer internships very late (the big companies have already filled their spots by the time I got to submit my resume). And then, a week before the end of the semester, my friend Jakub (the same person who was the subject of my linguistics paper in the fall) got enough funding for his start-up to devote his total attention to it over the summer and recommended me as an alternative candidate to the company where he has already secured a spot for an internship. So, this is how I ended up accepting an offer to work at Oasis in Lexington, MA, close to Cambridge. This is also why I’m only flying home for two weeks now; I’m going to spend my summer in the Boston area — after visiting some friends in the UK and Iceland on my way back. Saying goodbye to all the people who made the year awesome for me was much more difficult than last year. A lot more seniors who are close to me are graduating, and as much as I want them to leave MIT and become successful and content adults, I wish they stayed a bit more. Surprisingly, a lot of my friends are staying in or around Boston for the summer, so I’m going to see them at least. But I had to say goodbye to a special friend for these three months, who became very close to me over the past year — some would even say a bit too close.</p>
