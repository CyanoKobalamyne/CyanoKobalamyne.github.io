<p>I haven't posted anything since spring break, which is sad, but also shows how fast-paced life is at MIT (and even at home during the summer...). This also reminds me of the IJSO (International Junior Science Olympiad) blog that my dearest former high school Physics teacher starts writing again heroically every year about the current iteration of the competition but then never finishes. At least I have the advantage that the IJSO is usually slightly over a week long, while I'm going to stay at MIT for three more years at least (hopefully).</p>

<h2>An Unexpected (kind of) <b>Journey</b></h2>
<p>However, now, as I'm sitting (almost laying) in the Business Class (the first time in my life — that I can remember, at least) of Swiss's 8-hour flight from Zürich to Boston, I have plenty of time to write this post. But how did I get here? Well, I'm going back to MIT this early (actually, the same day as last year) to help out with International Orientation, and see the super excited international prefrosh (with some nostalgia). Now, I didn't book a seat for Business Class — the ticket was already expensive enough —, however, apparently, the plane was full, so Swiss just silently transferred me, which I discovered only when checking in yesterday. So I'm happy now, since there's plenty of space (about four times as much as in Economy Class), and plenty of pretty nice food. My parents are probably less so, since I left my I-20 form at home (a document required for people with student visas to be able to enter the US), and only remembered it when we were already at the airport, so they had to drive home, find it, and then rush back to the airport. But I (they) made it, yay! (Sorry, Mom and Dad.)</p>

<h2>My Fourth Half Semester</h2>
<p>Now let's pick up the chain of events where my last post left off. After spring break, studying unfolded with more intensity than ever, as I was solving problem sets (psets in MIT-speak), writing essays, and taking exams for my subjects. This spring I took five and three-quarter subjects (plus one as listener), so officially 57 units. Units are counted as hours spent studying that subject per week, and a normal subject has 12 units, which usually includes 2-3 hours of lectures, 0-2 hours of recitations, and 7-10 hours of homework. The subjects I took were 18.02, 8.02, 5.12, 1.016, and SP.360. At MIT we refer to subjects by numbers and occasionally letters, barely by names, where the part before the dot represents the course (department) offering the subject. But before decoding the meaning of these numbers, I'm going to talk a little bit about how the academic system works at MIT.</p>
<h2>GIRs, HASSes, and Numbers</h2>
<p>Every undergraduate student has to take (or otherwise get credit for) certain subjects designated as General Institute Requirements (GIRs). These can be divided into two major groups. The Science Core comprises six mandatory subjects, Calculus I &amp; II (single &amp; multi-variable), Physics I &amp; II (mechanics and E&amp;M), Chemistry, and Biology. Last fall I took Calculus I (18.01), an advanced version of Physics I (8.012, the normal version is 8.01), and an advanced version of Chemistry (5.112, the normal version is 5.111, and there is a Materials Science version, 3.091). From this, it can be inferred that Course 18 is Mathematics, Course 8 is Physics, Course 5 is Chemistry, and Course 3 is Materials Science and Engineering (we have courses numbered 1 to 24, with the exception of 13, 19 &amp; 23, which were abolished or merged into other courses, plus some with letters). And now it is also easier to guess that 18.02 and 8.02 which I took in the spring, are Calculus II and Physics II. (I wanted to take 8.022, the advanced version of the latter, but we were warned that it's quite difficult, so I only registered as a listener but I actually enjoyed it more than the regular 8.02). Notably absent on this list is Biology, also known as 7.01x (where x depends on the exact version of the subject), offered by Course 7 (Biology), which I'm going to take this coming semester.</p>
<p>The second group of GIRs comprise the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) requirement, containing 8 subjects, which can be chosen relatively freely among the many HASS subjects offered by the Institute. The major restriction is that there has to be at least one subject from each category: H, A, and S(S), and the five remaining ones have to form a coherent group, which is called your HASS Concentration. In my first semester I have taken 14.02, Macroeconomics (yet another course, number 14, our respected Department of Economics) a HASS-S (Social Science), which was chosen somewhat randomly by my advisor and me, but turned out to be great, I loved professor Caballero's analysis of recent news about world economy at the beginning of every lecture. Next semester I'm taking Introduction to Linguistics, 24.900 (the subject number is somewhat strange, since course 24 includes both Philosophy and Linguistics), which counts as HASS-H (Humanity), but I'm hoping to also make Linguistics my concentration. And, last but not least, I have also taken a HASS-A subject last semester, SP.360, where SP means that it's a special subject! It's special because it doesn't belong to any course or department but the Terrascope program.</p>
<h2>Being a Terrafrosh</h2>
<p>Terrascope is a Freshmen Learning Community — along with three others, the Experimental Study Group (ESG), Concourse, and the program in Media Arts and Sciences (MAS). These programs aim to better prepare incoming students to life at university and beyond, while also serving as a social space for the frosh (in our case the Terrafrosh) to get to know each other. Terrascope's focus is on environmental issues — theoretically, at least. I'm saying this because, even though the content of the subjects offered in the program is great, its true value lies in teaching students how to work together as a group (and many students entering the program are usually already highly interested and knowledgeable about the problems Earth is facing).</p>
<p>The first-semester subject is 12.000, dubbed Solving Complex Problems, or simply Mission (offered under the realms of the Department of Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences, Course 12). In Mission, Terrascope students investigate a major issue regarding the environment (this is different every year, ours was the cities' sustainability, resilience, and equity, which is pretty broad) over the course of the fall semester, and deliver a more than half-hour long presentation complete with a Q&amp;A session to a panel of experts and the general audience in 10-250, the iconic lecture hall under the MIT Dome (all the rooms are also referred to by their numbers, here, the first part refers to the building number (10), then comes the floor (2), and the room (50)). This subject gives the opportunity to learn to coordinate a larger group of people (around 40), since the students are the ones who organize their work, and even the classroom work later into the semester. This helps develop leadership skills and the ability to compromise, since the chance that this many MIT students agree on virtually any issue is zero.</p>

<p>In the spring, there are two subjects offered, which are smaller and facultative, the already mentioned SP.360 and 1.016 (Course 1 is Civil and Environmental Engineering). SP.360 is Terrascope Radio, where 12 people build a 15-20 minute long radio show together, after being taught the basics of storytelling, interviewing, recording, sound editing, and many more awesome things. Our piece was about Mexico City, as most students joined other Terrafrosh and visited this beautiful place (where I lived for a year about 7 years ago) — Terrascope organizes a subsidized field trip for its students and alumni every spring break. This was one of the most fun classes I took but also the most challenging, as we had to write essays every week... and I would take a thousand psets before an essay, to be honest. Last, but not least, there is 1.016, which is an engineering design class, where you get to design and then build an actual Thing with 3-4 fellow prospective engineers. I was super excited to take this class, as I really wanted to try some Real Engineering Tools (this is an engineering school, after all), and I'm not going to have many opportunities to do so in the future, since I'm a science major. Our team created a type of bike rack to be used on both the outside and inside of buses and other types of public transportation, which was much less ambitious than the city-wide network of moving walkways I had originally hoped for, but much more enjoyable and useful. Sadly, this was also the subject in which I got a B, since I routinely forgot to write the weekly required (and rather short) reflections. At least I also learnt something from that, I guess.</p>
<h2>The Last Days as a Frosh</h2>
<p>Towards the end of freshman year, two very important events take place: major declaration and the first finals for which we actually get grades (not just Pass, like first semester). Choosing a major (which is actually a course) is often difficult, as freshmen don't always quite know what they want to study. However, your major is pretty flexible, you can change it as many times as you want, you just need to fulfill the degree requirements of one course (in addition to the GIRs) to graduate. I chose 5-7, the joint program in Chemistry and Biology, but I plan to also add 6-3, Computer Science and Engineering, our biggest and most well-known course. You can have two majors, however, MIT (unfortunately) eliminated the possibility of third majors (and beyond) a couple of years ago, although it didn't affect a great deal of students, having two majors already requires taking an insane amount of classes if you don't have credit for some of them (which I don't). What having a major really means until you get your degree is that you get an advisor from your own department, who helps you choose subjects, can give advice on how to get a research project (which usually means participating in MIT's UROP program, which is an awesome opportunity for undergraduate to get research experience early on, and even get paid for it), etc. This meant that I had to say goodbye (in his official role) to Ari Epstein, my freshman advisor, one of the leaders of the Terrascope program, who also taught my two spring Terrascope subjects, and who is a really great teacher and person. You also get access to your department's lounges, get invited to course-wide events, but nothing will prevent you for taking completely unrelated subjects for fun. (MIT students can even cross-register for classes at Harvard and a couple other universities in Greater Boston!)</p>
<p>Finals Week is less fun for most people (the people who have finals). After having an one-day break from classes (plus weekend) students take several 2-3 hour long written exams over the course of five days. Not all classes have finals, so for example I had three both semesters of the past academic year, since neither Terrascope subjects, nor the fall version of Macroeconomics have finals. The former have final projects, however, which usually means several afternoons and nights spent in the classroom/lab until everything is finished, so they're even more demanding than final exams, but at least you can see the product of your hard work.</p>
<p>These were not actually my last days as a frosh, however. As Rachel D. ’16 notes in <a href="http://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/let-there-be-prefrosh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her post on the MIT Admissions Blogs</a>, frosh are always conserved, so I will continue being one until the current prefrosh become frosh at Convocation during Orientation. I hope to write another post about that a bit later, together with its International cousin, and how I spent my first summer as a now 20-year-old university student.</p>
