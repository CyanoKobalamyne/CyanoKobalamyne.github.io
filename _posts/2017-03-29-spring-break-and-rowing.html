<p>Yesterday spring break has officially started at MIT. This is the time of the year when the campus becomes almost empty, with many students going home or traveling somewhere. Most of my friends in Number Six (my fraternity) have left to Colombia, my friends in Terrascope to Mexico City, and so on. Yet, I haven't joined any of them but am staying on campus. Why? Because I love MIT so much that I can't leave it.</p>

<p>Not literally, of course. I mean, I really love my university, but I love traveling too, and I have already spent a decent amount of time here (I barely leave the campus). However, the crew team has practice over the break, and I happen to be part of it, so I have no other choice but to stay. And if you think that at least this way I get to have more free time to do whatever I want than the people who are traveling, then you're very mistaken, because we have two practice sessions every day, which takes up most of our time, and we need the rest to, well, rest, and regenerate.</p>
<p>Now, it's an interesting story how I became a member of the MIT's varsity crew team in the first place. At the very beginning of my time here, in September, I had a meeting with my academic advisor — as every other freshman. At the end of our meeting, he, Ari, casually asked me if I wanted to do any kind of sports here. And when I said yes, he went on to recommend rowing, as he had very good experiences with it when he was an undergrad (at another university). The same day, while taking the boat test as part of the mandatory freshman swimming test, I came across a girl who happened to be a rower, and kindly invited me to the open grill party hosted by MIT Crew at the boathouse.</p>
<p>My journey there was an adventure on its own, as I didn't know at that time that MIT had both a boathouse and a sailing pavilion, which aren't the same thing, and went to the latter instead of the former. I had a great time there with some slightly surprised first-year students from the Sloan School of Management, who were enjoying their end-of-orientation dinner, but they kindly allowed me to briefly join them. After realizing my mistake (and eating the best dinner I have ever had at MIT), however, I ran to the other side of the Harvard bridge, where the party was already on. The rest is history. I met the heavyweight team's freshman coach (I was on the border between heavyweight and lightweight but I love eating, so...), talked to the rowing director, and joined the walk-on program the next week.</p>
<p>The journey from not even knowing how to hold an oar to being in the 2V boat (as of now, and hopefully later on, too) has been long and tedious but it was worth it. Rowing is the only division I sport at MIT, so it's taken pretty seriously (it is expected to be the number two priority for everyone, after academics). We have practice 20 hours a week, and have to get up at 6 a.m. every morning during the semester. Nevertheless, it is one of the very few sports, which use most muscles in your body to the same extent (this was one of the reasons for choosing it), and the team is very supportive, even of the pathetic, slow, and clueless walk-ons like me.</p>
