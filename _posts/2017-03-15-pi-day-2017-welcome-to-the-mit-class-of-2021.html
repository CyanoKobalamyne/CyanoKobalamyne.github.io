<p>Exactly one year ago (it was March 15 early morning in Hungary), I got an admission letter from MIT. Many feelings ran through me in that instant. First, disbelief, then relief, happiness, and satisfaction at the same time. More than a thousand students have experienced the same feelings just a few hours ago. However, I know that there were even more who got the less pleasant experience of being rejected. I know that one too, I wasn't admitted everywhere I applied.</p>
<p>It was also a year ago when I decided to write a blog about my experiences here, at MIT. And while this was swept away by the overwhelming amount of things that happened in the last months, I have never given up. And, well, better late than never, isn't it?</p>
<p>The birth of this post was facilitated by the fact that we had a snow day yesterday, for which I would like to thank the weather in New England. Unfortunately, it didn't snow for long enough to write an actually informative post but I promise I will be trying to improve.</p>
<p>My life here has pretty much reached a steady-state equilibrium (to use a chemistry-related metaphor). I'm taking five (and a half) subjects, practicing 20 hours a week as a member of the MIT crew team, and working more or less the same amount as the Production Editor of The Tech. It's hard to find time for other things alongside these commitments but I do have a social life, however hard it is to believe. I hope to shed more light on the details of my life in the following posts but that's it for now. I'm off to classes.</p>
