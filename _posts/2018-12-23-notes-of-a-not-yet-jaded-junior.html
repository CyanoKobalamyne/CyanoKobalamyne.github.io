<p class="has-drop-cap">
Another semester has come to and end. It’s incredible to think that<br />
I have spent two and a half years in the United States now, and if I<br />
stay for a fifth year at MIT, I’m halfway through my studies. This<br />
fall has been a roller-coaster, in many ways. I have definitely<br />
tested my limits in terms of academics (not that I haven’t been<br />
doing that in the past semesters). I also learned to appreciate my<br />
friends and my second family at Number Six more. And although I still<br />
don’t know exactly what I want to do after graduation, even less<br />
what I’m doing until then, I have a bit clearer picture of who I<br />
want to be 10 years from now. Just in time for those job interviews.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>But before we delve into my studies et al, a quick recap of the summer. The last blog post is from May and, as usual, I’m writing this after finals on a plane back from Boston and while waiting for my transfer in Dublin. As stated in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog/a-tribute-to-sophomore-year/">the previous post</a>, after spending some time at home, visiting some friends in England, and passing by Reykjavík, I spent my summer in Boston. Okay, I spent the workdays in Boston. Actually, to be accurate, I spent the days in Lexington but stayed in <del>Boston</del> Cambridge. Now that we established this, let’s see what I was doing and why I wasn’t really in Boston. (Cambridge. Greater Boston. Whatever.) I was working for Ocean Acoustical Services and Instrumentation Systems, Inc., or OASIS for short, as a machine learning intern (although my title was the rather cryptic “staff engineer”). This mostly meant that I woke up (tried to wake up) early to catch the ever-late red line to the Alewife terminal, then took the bus to Lexington, sat in an office for eight hours, occasionally getting up to bother other people with my questions or answer their questions and to make a brief trip to Neillio’s<sup><a id="#endnote1-place" href="#endnote1">1</a></sup> for a lunch sandwich around noon, and made the same trip back home. It was actually more exciting than this, I just wanted to describe the pain of reverse-commuting over an hour every day to a place that was much closer to Number Six than my high school was to my home in Hungary, which trip took me less than 45 minutes on most days. By public transportation!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Anyway, I worked on<br />
a project that entailed analyzing underwater acoustical signals<br />
(sound emitted from boats), and trying to make sense of them (e.g.<br />
telling the boat’s direction and speed) using the magical tools of<br />
machine learning. It was a great learning experience, frustrating at<br />
times, but overall a good first work experience. (Yeah, I haven’t<br />
actually worked before. For real money, at least.) The work itself<br />
was not something I can imagine myself doing long-term, as it<br />
required running looong computations on neural nets, looking at the<br />
results (or lack thereof, usually), then trying to figure out what<br />
went wrong, changing a parameter, and repeating everything from the<br />
beginning. (This sounds like research, no? Oops.) But the potential<br />
applications were cool, even though much of the “real” work at<br />
the company required security clearance, so, being a foreigner, I had<br />
no idea what they were doing. But I was developing tools for them.<br />
How ironic. My coworkers also made my time a lot more entertaining<br />
than it would have been otherwise. The company is really small, with<br />
maybe 20-25 employees total, although I never saw all of them in the<br />
office at the same time. I was mostly working directly with the CEO,<br />
the VP, and a senior engineer, getting together to meet and assess<br />
the status of the project every once in a while. Their approaches to<br />
the problem at hand were quite different. The CEO was pretty excited<br />
about using ML tools to complement (or replace?) their existing<br />
methods, while the VP was very skeptical, and sent me an article my<br />
first day that described how easy it was to confuse image<br />
classification networks. Together, we made an all-expenses-paid trip<br />
to Gloucester, a port city north of Boston, to make some<br />
measurements. And my project continues to live on in the hands of<br />
Max, a fellow (former) student who started as a full-time engineer<br />
this summer.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When I wasn’t in<br />
Massachusetts, I was watching the World Cup in New York, pretending<br />
to be a tourist in Seattle, hiking in New Hampshire with MITOC (the<br />
MIT Outing Club) with some Brits – my friend Tafsia, who is in<br />
MITOC, and Petra (a fellow Hungarian!) and Clemency from Imperial<br />
College who were working at Mass General Hospital in Boston and<br />
living in Number Six over the summer –, visiting my family in<br />
Miami, or dancing at the Sziget Festival in Budapest (I surprised my<br />
parents and went back home at the end of the summer). I made half of<br />
all my trips (to New York, Miami, and Budapest) with Maddy, whom I<br />
met at the MIT MUN conference in February (where I was a committee<br />
chair, long story) and with whom I have spent a probably unhealthy<br />
amount of time over the past year. But it was a lot of fun and I’m<br />
looking forward to the next!</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After the end of my<br />
internship and right before the beginning of Number Six’s work week<br />
(when we actually clean the house) and rush (when we rope<br />
unsuspecting victims into cleaning the house with us next year), I<br />
co-coordinated International Orientation. Because I can’t say no to<br />
anything. But it was awesome! I got to meet all of the international<br />
frosh (and transfers) and tried to make sure that none of them get<br />
hit by a car. Or a student. Or a tourist. Or the T.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As the semester<br />
begun, I started off with way too many classes, because I couldn’t<br />
or didn’t want to decide what I wanted to get out of them.<br />
(Consequently, the majority of this blog post will be about<br />
academics.) I was pretty ambitious, and decided to register for 3<br />
chemistry, 2 Computers Science, and 2 Math classes. That’s a lot. I<br />
would definitely not recommend. The beginning of the semester was<br />
kind of okay, but by the fifth week the workload got pretty high and<br />
I had to drop something.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The first decision wasn’t hard. I started taking 5.43, Advanced Organic Chemistry, because I love orgo and after being bored for a semester in 5.12 and taking the Advanced Standing Exam<sup><a id="endnote2-place" href="#endnote2">2</a></sup> for 5.13 (Organic Chemistry I &amp; II, respectively), I though that this would be a class that I would genuinely enjoy and where I would learn new things. This might turn out to be true another semester, but not this one. Apparently, if you want to know the material in advanced classes, you have to go to lecture (or at least I do). The problem was, lectures were at 9:30, and, even though I had to get up at 6:30 for 12+ years to go to school then at 6 a.m. to go to crew practice for my first three semesters at MIT, I’m not an early riser. Consequently, I missed practically every lecture (I think I went to 2 in total). And, (not) surprisingly, I did not do well on the first exam. Honestly, I was surprised I even passed it. So 5.43 had to go.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It took me much longer to decide to drop the chemistry lab modules. For context, both the 5 (Chemistry) and the 5-7 (Chemistry and Biology) majors, the latter of which I’m officially enrolled in, require students to take all 12 “Mods” (officially called URIECA<sup><a id="endnote3-place" href="#endnote3">3</a></sup>) offered by the department. These are essentially four to five week (third semester) long courses, where students learn laboratory techniques centered around a certain topic. I think this is an interesting approach, since most universities have lab components associated with the standard courses (organic, inorganic, biological chemistry, etc.), not standalone subjects. And I’m sure that this approach works great for many undergrads but I had some personal problems with it. First, I went to a high school where we had separate chemistry laboratory classes – which is probably not the case with most students in the U.S. –, and I got extra practice while preparing for the International Chemistry Olympiad, so I didn’t really feel I was learning a lot. (Sure, my school didn’t have fancy NMR machines and the like, but that’s not really the point of these classes.) Second, the workload was very high. We had to write “pre-lab” drafts, attend 8 hours of lab sessions every week, write a final report, and give a final presentation at the end of the first module. Since I had numerous other things to worry about, I ended up doing most of these assignments – including the final report and presentation, unfortunately – the day of, or sometimes the night before, with the expected results.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It was still pretty shocking to get my first C<sup><a id="endnote4-place" href="#endnote4">4</a></sup> at MIT. Even more so after my TA regularly remarked that I had a very deep understanding of the material, so the pre-lab quizzes – that many of my classmates were extremely stressed about – should be smooth sailing for me. Normally, this would make me seriously question the fairness of the grading in a class, but our instructors felt that in case of a lab, execution was more important than knowledge. And who am I to disagree?</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>After this, I was not exactly excited for the second module. I found the topic a bit more interesting than the previous one and I also happened to do a very similar experiment in high school but it was just too much. Mod 2 is one of the chemistry CI-Ms<sup><a id="endnote5-place" href="#endnote5">5</a></sup> so it was even more work than the Mod 1. In the middle of a particularly bad week, while trying to write my topic proposal for the class at 4 a.m. or so, I decided that I ain’t wanna Mod no more. In the end, why was I in this class? Because it was a graduation requirement? At the first meeting with my biology advisor, he told me that one of the most important things I should remember is to never take a class just because it’s required. And, to be honest, that was the only reason I was taking the labs. I really liked my classmates and my TA, and we were in the fancy new MIT.nano building, but I wasn’t particularly excited about waiting for hours for a reaction to happen, and overall it felt like a waste of time. As I’m not planning to go to graduate school in chemistry, and, realistically, I’m not going to be working as a wet-lab chemist either, I didn’t see the point in improving my lab skills. So, the next day, I went to talk to my chemistry advisor, and I dropped the second and third lab modules.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The third<br />
(technically, fifth) chemistry class I was enrolled in was Physical<br />
Chemistry, which turned out to be rather different from what I<br />
expected. In my mind, physical chemistry was mostly just<br />
thermodynamics and friends. Apparently, once you leave high school,<br />
physical chemistry becomes quantum mechanics. And I happen to like<br />
quantum mechanics, so that was not a bad thing, in fact, quite the<br />
opposite. However, I still had to drop part of the class. How did I<br />
only drop part of it, you ask? For some reason, the new flexible<br />
option for chemistry majors requires students to take the first half<br />
of 5.60, thermodynamics, and 5.61, this class, instead of just the<br />
entirety of one of them. Consequently, both classes were split in<br />
two. Since I have mostly given up on completing my 5-7 major at this<br />
point –  I realized that I enjoy taking CS and math classes a lot<br />
more than chemistry and biology –, I only registered for the first<br />
half. (I even submitted my concentration proposal for the flexible 5<br />
major.) I liked the class and I did really well in it, so after it<br />
was over, I decided to register for the second half as well. Big<br />
mistake. As my other classes got harder, I stopped going to lectures,<br />
and I had no idea what was happening in the class when I took the<br />
first exam (of the second half). I dropped it the next day.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>I had a better<br />
experience with my Computer Science classes. One of them was 6.046,<br />
Design and Analysis of Algorithms. This is the second subject in<br />
algorithms at MIT, after 6.006, Introduction to Algorithms. I had a<br />
of fun with the Fast Fourier Transform, flow networks, reductions to<br />
3-SAT, and cryptographic hashing, among others, but the class was<br />
pretty challenging, I barely managed to get an A. The other class I<br />
took was 6.172, Performance Engineering of Software Systems. This<br />
class is legendary at MIT. It’s an advanced undergraduate subject<br />
in CS, and carries 18 units, so it’s 1.5 times a normal class. It’s<br />
incredibly time-consuming but very rewarding. At the beginning of the<br />
semester I definitely didn’t invest enough time in it (reasons<br />
above). This resulted in my partner doing most of the work for<br />
project 1. (Sorry, Nikita, I hope you’ll forgive me once!) But<br />
after that I felt pretty bad and tried to compensate for the rest of<br />
the semester. The last project turned out to be really hard, and<br />
resulted in me spending many of my nights bent over my computer on<br />
the sixth floor of Baker House (where two people on the team lived),<br />
and asking for many extensions for my other classes. But we made<br />
(improved) a bot that can play Leiserchess! (A chess with lasers, by<br />
Prof. Leiserson. Yes, the other puns made by the teaching staff were<br />
of similar quality.)</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>And now we can talk<br />
about Math. The only reason why I took Math classes this semester is<br />
that I had nothing better to do (haha). Actually, though, one of them<br />
does not count towards my degree in any shape or form, however, I<br />
managed to get the other one count as an advanced CS class. The<br />
former class is 18.701, Algebra I. It sounds like the most basic<br />
class ever but along with Real Analysis (which I took last fall) it<br />
was the most challenging subject I have taken at MIT. In Analysis we<br />
at least talked about things that I can see and use elsewhere:<br />
sequences, limits, derivatives. But in Algebra, the goal is to make<br />
everything sufficiently abstract such that no reasonable human being<br />
can find a practical application for it. Okay, quantum physicists can<br />
use some of them but it’s questionable whether that field is<br />
reasonable. Oh yeah, my other class was Quantum Computation, a<br />
graduate subject, offered jointly by the departments of Physics (as<br />
8.370), Math (as 18.435), and Mechanical Engineering (don’t ask<br />
what they want to do with quantum computers). It was quite<br />
interesting, and I gained almost as much insight into the life of<br />
grad students and postdocs as into that of quantum bits from the<br />
lectures of Professor Seth Lloyd. And we actually used some of those<br />
abstract things from 18.701! Sadly, we only covered them in Algebra<br />
at the end of the semester (and, obviously, we practically started<br />
with them in 18.435), but I appreciated the beauty of SU2 double<br />
covering SO3 in retrospect as well.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A few weeks into the<br />
semester I felt that I’m not busy enough, so I started taking two<br />
seminars. One of them, 15.S51, that is, Key Employment Law Issues for<br />
Employees, Enterpreneurs, and Managers (I don’t know how Sloan<br />
professors come up with these names), was actually only in the second<br />
half of the semester, when I already dropped plenty of classes. It<br />
was very interesting and extremely useful to someone who had<br />
absolutely no idea about how employment in the U.S. worked and had to<br />
sign an offer letter for his first internship but didn’t get an<br />
employment contract, only blank stares when inquiring about one (i.e.<br />
me). My other seminar was even more interesting, if possible.<br />
11.S941, Understanding MIT, is taught by Prof. Bob Simha, a former<br />
Director of Planning of the Institute. He invited a different speaker<br />
every week, who talked about their aspects of managing the<br />
university. We had Glen Shor, VP for Finance, Stu Schmill, Dean of<br />
Admissions, Suzy Nelson, Dean for Student Life, and even Jan<br />
Devereaux, the Vice Mayor of Cambridge, among many others, with us.<br />
The composition of people taking the class was also quite<br />
interesting; there were a couple of grad students (one from BU), MIT<br />
staff members from Resource Development, and two undergraduates. All<br />
we had to do was to listen, ask questions, and submit a paper at the<br />
end of the semester, which I should be working on right now instead<br />
of this blog post.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>With all these<br />
classes you would think that I’m not doing anything else but you<br />
would be wrong. I was never good at doing a few things well. Granted,<br />
I spent the vast majority of my time studying in the Danforth (the<br />
library of Number Six) or in the office of The Tech, but between two<br />
problem sets I also tried to contribute something to the two<br />
communities on campus that provide me with emotional support and<br />
food. This semester I was the risk manager for Number Six, which<br />
meant that I had to supervise all of our parties. It was a pretty<br />
exhausting task; I had to circle around to make sure there are<br />
members at the door, we don’t have too many guests inside, we don’t<br />
have any guests outside, and occasionally had to talk to the police<br />
when they came to the house at 4 a.m., angry that someone in<br />
MacGregor (the dorm across the street) filed a noise complaint. I<br />
continued to be Managing Editor of The Tech (I have been in this role<br />
since May 2017), so I had to read and write lots of emails.<br />
Fortunately, our production department is pretty well staffed now,<br />
and run by some spectacular production editors, so I didn’t have to<br />
worry about that. And a few weeks ago I had the honor of being<br />
elected as Publisher for next year (this is just a fancy name for our<br />
president), so I will read and write even more emails than before, in<br />
exchange for having my name appear 5 cm higher on the masthead.</p>
