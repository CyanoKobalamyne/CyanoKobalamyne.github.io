Born to a Hungarian mother and a Cuban father, I consider myself international.
I have lived in Budapest, Mexico City, and Boston but I'm a proud citizen of
the European Union. I'm passionate about science, especially Chemistry, and
the Oxford comma. Nevertheless, I'm studying Computer Science as a third-year
undergraduate student at the Massachusetts Insitute of Technology with my
international family in [Number Six](http://no6.mit.edu). I'm also a
journalist at _[The Tech](https://thetech.com)_, albeit not one that writes
articles. In my rather rare free time I write code and design websites like
this one.
